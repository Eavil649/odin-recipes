        <p>
            If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting
            a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast,
            this recipe is for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1 (4 pounds) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well
                blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously
                with kosher salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger
                or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit
                in the oven for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>

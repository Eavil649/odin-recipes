        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Pasteles are a type of tamal made with a masa of plaintain
            and yuca. They are a traditional dish, especially around
            the holidays, in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean cultures.
            Like tamales, making pasteles is a family affair.

        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <h4><em>Preparing the picadillo:</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the achiote oil in a pot. Sauté the sofrito
                in the oil for about a minute, then add the chunks
                of pork and continue sautéing until the meat is browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the water, garbanzo beans, tomato sauce, olives, ham flavoring,
                oregano, salt, and pepper to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then
                reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the liquid from the picadillo, separating 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the liquid
                from the auce to use for the masa later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the picadillo cool and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><em>Preparing the masa:</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Peel all the green bananas, plaintains, Yautio, Yuca,
                kabocha squash, and potatoes and cut them into small pieces
                (note: yuca is very hard). <em>Tip:</em> Keep the pieces in cold
                salty water to keep them from darkening while waiting to be grated. Dry the pieces
                before adding them to the food processer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grate or finely shred the vegetable pieces using a food processor
                adding some of the reserved picadillo sauce while grating.
            </li>
            <li>
                Empty the grated masa into a large bowl and keep grating the rest of the vegetable
                pieces. Stir the masa in the large bowl as you add new batches
                to make sure the ingredients are proportional throughout. If desired, you 
                can add more sauce or achiote oil to the masa for adding coloring.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><em>Stuffing the pasteles:</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut parchment paper into 12x12-inch or 12x18 inch pieces (if not using
                pre-cute pastel wrappers). Rub a little achiote oil in the center (about 5-inch
                square) and place a banana leaf of about the same size over it. Rub a little oil
                on the leaf as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 3/4 cup of the masa on top of the leaf and spread to approximately cover the leaf
                leaving a small indentation in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1/4 of the picadillo in the indentation at the masa center. 
                <em>Tip:</em> Make sure the picadillo is drained or the liquid will run out of the
                pastel while you're wrapping it.
        </ol>
        <h4><em>Wrapping the pasteles:</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fold the paper (with the masa already applied) by grabbing the long ends
                and bringing them up to touch and align with each other. The masa will have overlapped
                the picadillo filling, sealing the filling inside the masa.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold both edges of the paper together tightly and fold once again tightly
                (about 1 1/2 inch folds). The last fold should bring the papear over the now
                elongated pastel masa.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the two remaining ends individually twice tightly towwards the masa; the
                fold should rest on top of the masa when done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Snugly tie a string of butcher's twine lengthwise around the pastel and secure in
                the center leaving enough string to wrap around the waist of the pastel. Tie the
                ends of the string snugly around the pastel and tie into a bow or knot. Cut the ends
                short. <em>Tip:</em> If you're not sure one string around the waist is secure enough,
                wrap two strings evenly spaced around waist of the pastel instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pasteles may be frozen raw until needed.
            </li>
        </ol>
